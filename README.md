# **World Airports Dashboard üåç‚úàÔ∏è**

## **Overview**
The **World Airports Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI visualization that provides insights into airports worldwide. It includes key metrics such as **airport distribution by country, runway specifications, elevation levels, airport types, and scheduled services**. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and transformed using **Power Query and DAX** to ensure data accuracy and usability.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: [Kaggle - World Airports Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/world-airports?resource=download)
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:
  - Used **Power Query** to change data types and convert binary values to text.
  - Created **new calculated columns** using **DAX**.
  - Filtered and structured the dataset for efficient visualization.

## **Key Features of the Dashboard**
1. **Global Airport Distribution** üåç  
   - Interactive **map visualization** showing airport locations by latitude and longitude.
   - Filterable **country-wise airport count** representation.

2. **Runway Analysis** üõ´  
   - **Runway length vs. width** scatter plot for comparative analysis.
   - Identification of **airports with longest and widest runways**.

3. **Airport Classification** ‚úàÔ∏è  
   - Distribution of **airports by type** (small, medium, large, heliport, etc.).
   - Elevation-based classification of airports.

4. **Lighting and Scheduled Service Analysis** üí°  
   - Breakdown of **airports with lighted runways** vs. non-lighted ones.
   - **Scheduled service availability** insights (percentage of airports offering commercial flights).
